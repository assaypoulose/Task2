  <h1>Difference between window and document objects</h1>
  <p>
    In this example, we'll demonstrate the difference between the `window` and `document` objects in HTML and JavaScript.
  </p>
  <h2>The `window` object</h2>
  <p>
    The `window` object represents the browser window itself, and contains various properties and methods related to the window, such as the `screen` object, which describes the user's screen size, and the `navigator` object, which contains information about the user's browser.
  </p>
  <pre>
    console.log('Window width:', window.innerWidth);
    console.log('Screen width:', screen.width);
    console.log('Browser name:', navigator.appName);
  </pre>
  <h2>The `document` object</h2>
  <p>
    The `document` object represents the HTML document that is currently loaded in the window. It contains various properties and methods related to the HTML document, such as the `head` and `body` elements, as well as all the other HTML elements on the page.
  </p>
  <pre>
    console.log('Document title:', document.title);
    console.log('Heading text:', document.querySelector('h1').textContent);
    console.log('Number of links:', document.links.length);
  </pre>
</body>
